Step 1: Let's say we have code in the GIT Repository (For Existing Org based Development)
Step 2: Convert the existing code in the GIT Repository to SFDX Format (This can be done using the CLI)
Step 3: Understand the Features we are using to create correct Org Shape (For Scratch Orgs)
Step 4: Understanding and Scripting all the features or additional customization so that those can be applied to scratch orgs.
Step 5: Scripting sample data which needed to be pushed to scratch orgs for development
